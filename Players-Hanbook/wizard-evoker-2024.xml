    <description>
      <p>Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, choose a number of them up to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</p>

  <!-- ===== Level 14: Overchannel ===== -->
  <element name="Overchannel" type="Archetype Feature" source="Player's Handbook (2024)" id="ID_WOTC_PHB24_WIZARD_EVOKER_FEATURE_OVERCHANNEL">
    <description>
      <p>You can increase the power of your spells. When you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1â€“5 that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell on the turn you cast it.</p>
      <p class="indent">The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a Long Rest, you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity. Each subsequent use before you finish a Long Rest increases the Necrotic damage per spell level by 1d12.</p>
