		<description>
			<p>Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.</p>
			<p class="indent">Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists' activities.</p>
			<p class="indent">Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.</p>
			<h4>POWER OF NATURE</h4>
			<p>Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.</p>
			<p class="indent">Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animalsâ€” the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.</p>
			<h4>PRESERVE THE BALANCE</h4>
			<p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a worldâ€”air, earth, fire, and waterâ€”must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.</p>
			<p class="indent">Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.</p>
			<p class="indent">Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A DRUID</h4>
			<p>When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.</p>
			<p class="indent">Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>

		<description>
			<p>You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class's description.</p>
			<h5>Cantrips</h5>
			<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft and Produce Flame are recommended. Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list. When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.</p>
			<h5>Spell Slots</h5>
			<p>The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
			<h5>Prepared Spells of Level 1+</h5>
			<p>You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship, Cure Wounds, Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave are recommended.</p>
			<p class="indent">The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.</p>
			<p class="indent">If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.</p>
			<h5>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</h5>
			<p>Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
			<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>
			<p>You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.</p>

You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.</p>
			<p class="indent">Number of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.</p>
			<h5>Known Forms</h5>
			<p>You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see appendix B for stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.</p>
			<p class="indent">When choosing known forms, you may look in the Monster Manual or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.</p>

			<p><strong>Rules While Transformed.</strong> While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Temporary Hit Points.</strong> When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Game Statistics.</strong> Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>No Spellcasting.</strong> You can't cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Objects.</strong> Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.</p>
